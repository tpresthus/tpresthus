### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Thomas Presthus, and I've been coding for more than 20 years.

- ğŸ‘· I work at [Erus Encodia](https://www.erus.no) as Principal Consultant
- ğŸ“š I used to compile lists of books and articles - they're available as repos on here
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Linux, Domain-Driven Design and API architecture
- ğŸ”— And I've tried to blog several times, but never sticking to it, at [Ball of Code](https://www.ballofcode.com)
